# Game_bigger_or_lower_number

- In this simple game, you have to guess whether the next number is bigger or lower than the one shown.
- The game starts with the starting number **`5`**, and the program generates the next number using the random method in the interval from `1 to 11` (which means that numbers from 1 to 10 are guessed because 11 is not included).
- You can certainly change the starting number in the code, as well as the interval in which the next number is guessed.
- After a wrong choice, the game ends, and you get a corresponding message.
- You start a new game by pressing the **`Reset`** button.

> [!NOTE]
> - **`sn`** variable name stands for the starting number
> - **`c`** variable name stands for the counter (counter of hit numbers)
> - **`l1`** variable name refers to Label in Tkinter for the starting number
> - **`l2`** variable name refers to Label in Tkinter for the text when the game ends (when the player chooses the wrong number)

The game is written in:
1. Python (using OOP - classes and Tkinter as GUI)
2. PyScript
> [!NOTE]
> PyScript is a framework that enables users to create interactive web applications by writing Python code that runs in the browser, integrating seamlessly with HTML and JavaScript.
3. JavaScript code (of course, HTML and CSS as well)
